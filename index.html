          <img src="diane_willis.png" style="text-align: -webkit-auto;" />In
          Spring, 1995, Diane Willis traveled through a black tunnel, saw a
          white light and her life was changed forever. Since then, she has been
          guided from “one amazing experience to another,” as she set about
          accomplishing the mission she was given: to help others lose their
          fear of death.
        </p>
        <p>
          In May, 1998, Diane was guided to start the Chicago chapter of IANDS,
          which continues to grow, and in June, 2004, hosted the North American
          conference of IANDS. She also spends time working in hospice and
          consulting with people who have death-related issues. In May, 2008,
          she and the Chicago IANDS Board initiated the beginnings of a new
          organization, The International Society for Extraordinary Experiences
          (iSee), which is for a broader spectrum of experiences. (<a

        </p>
        <p>
          Being a Gemini, she has to have two paths going and after a trip to
          Egypt (on three days notice) in 1995, she was led to start improvising
          music, a skill she did not have before she went to the other side. She
          has performed on her Native American flutes with some of the world’s
          greatest spiritual teachers, including Louise Hay, Marianne
          Williamson, Caroline Myss, Ron Roth, Sonia Choquette, Paul Winter and
          others, including Cecil Taylor. She facilitated the Chicago Native
          Flutes Circle, a monthly meeting which explores many aspects of the
          Native American flute and flute-playing and her first CD,
          Improvisations From the Other Side: Healing Music for Meditation and
          Relaxation, came out in August, 2003.

          <p>
            “'Improvisations From The Other Side' by Diane Willis and John Fish
            is quite a surprise. I say this because it is so good, so
            refreshing, so mystical that it ranks way ‘up there’ with the best
            of Native American flute pieces and talented artists. Diane, I knew
            you were good but I didn’t know you were THAT good. This is one of
            my favorite CDs and I play it often. Highly recommended!”

        <h2>About Diane Willis</h2>
        <p>
          In Spring, 1995, Diane Willis had an experience which she later
          learned was within the parameters of what is called a Near-Death
          Experience. She went through a black tunnel and saw a white light
          which she immediately identified as being the source of all, or what
          we most often call God.She communicated telepathically and experienced
          love beyond anything that she had ever known. The love was so strong
          she could hold it, physically, in her hands and squeeze it. She was
          told “Love is the only thing that matters—how much you give, and how
          much you receive. Nothing else makes any real difference.” It was
          clear to her that we do not die and she came back with a passion to
          help others lose their fear of death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before this experience, Diane had not been on a spiritual path. She
          believed in God, but felt He was far away. This experience taught her
          that God was truly everywhere. She started meditating and was in close
          connection with her guides and God on the other side. Miraculous,
          synchronous things began to happen. She started doing hospice work,
          because that seemed to be the place where one could be the closest to
          the other side. And she was guided to start the Chicago chapter of
          theInternational Association for Near-Death Studies in May, 1998.
        </p>
        <p>
          Six months after her experience on the other side, in November, 1995,
          she was told by her guides to go to Egypt on three day’s notice—“and
          take your flute,” although she didn’t know why. When she got on the
          plane, she was seated next to a member of Marianne Williamson’s
          entourage. She had never heard of Marianne Williamson, who is a
          well-known spiritual teacher, author,and minister. When she got to
          Egypt, her roommate was Marianne’s personal assistant. And while she
          was there, she and Marianne conducted a service in the King’s Chamber
          of the Great Pyramid. Before going to the other side, Diane played a
          traditional flute, but had never been able to improvise two notes in a
          row. But that night, for the first time in her life she improvised
          music in the dark, resonant room, deep inside the Great Pyramid, while
          Marianne blessed the people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Diane knew, however, that something was missing in her performance,
          and in February, 1996, she had the opportunity to improvise, for the
          second time in her life, with Paul Winter on his soprano sax, who was
          very supportive and encouraging. However, this time she had the
          benefit of some lessons from “Sonic Meditations” with Pauline Oliveros
          to fill in the gap in her knowledge. These things happened completely
          synchronistically, in very guided ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          In October, 1996, a Native American flute maker from Colorado called
          her and told her that he was supposed to make her some flutes. Because
          she had not contacted him, she felt that she was to accept the flutes,
          although she wasn’t particularly interested because she had one which
          wasn’t very good. These new flutes, however, were more vibrant and
          responsive. It wasn’t long before she had the opportunity to try them
          out with Louise Hay, Ma Jaya Sati Bhagavati, Ron Roth, Sonia
          Choquette, Caroline Myss, Caroline Sutherland, Cecil Taylor and
          others. She suddenly found herself improvising in front of audiences
          of hundreds of people. In June, 2000, Diane was guided to meet R.C.
          Nakai, the award-winning Native American flutist, who listened to her
          music and told her that she should make CD’s because she was bringing
          through her experience on the other side and it would be very healing
          and helpful to people.
        </p>
        <p>
          John Fish has always been passionate about making music with other
          musicians and singers. Highlights of his career include being Music
          Director of the University Theater Summer Repertory at the University
          of Illinois and accompanying Tony-nominated actor, John Herrera. John
          and Diane met when their mutual friend, Ginnie Hartzer, invited them
          to play for her son’s wedding in September, 2000. Discovering a shared
          interest in improvisation, the two got together one evening in a
          studio and, with no preparation or plan, simply started playing.
          Within twenty minutes,+three of the pieces on this CD were recorded:
          Eagle Dream, Winterbird, and Moonlight. The other pieces were recorded
          in a few more sessions spaced over the next two years. Diane and John
          were amazed by how this music evolved and they knew that there was a
          greater guidance at work here. Obviously, timing was important.
          Although they had the music ready, the energy surrounding the CD
          didn’t intensify until Summer of 2003, when everything suddenly fell
          into place to create this offering.
        </p>
        <h3>The Near-Death Experience</h3>
        <p>
          The near-death experience (NDE) is among the most powerful experiences
          that a person can have, one of a family of experiences which may occur
          with or without being close to death. It may permanently alter a
          person’s perceptions of what is real and important. It is estimated
          that over 23,000,000 people in the United States have had this
          experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          One most extraordinary aspect of NDEs is that the underlying pattern
          seems unaffected by a person’s culture or belief system, religion,
          race, education, or any other known variable, although the way in
          which the NDE is described varies according to the person’s background
          and vocabulary. There is no evidence that the type of experience is
          related to whether the person is conventionally religious or not, or
          has lived a “good” or “bad” life according to his/her society’s
          standards (although an NDE often strongly affects how life is lived
          after the experience).
        </p>
        <p>
          An experience may include the feeling of being out of the physical
          body, moving through a darkness or tunnel, encountering the presence
          of deceased loved ones and/or other entities, and an indescribable
          light or menacing darkness. Many people say they have glimpsed the
          pattern and meaning of life and the universe, or have been given
          information beyond ordinary human capacities. For most people the
          experience is joyful beyond words, although others tell of unpleasant
          or terrifying experiences. When adequately understood, every type of
          NDE reveals issues of deep significance to the life of the individual
          and to humankind in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          Research has shown that NDEs in Western civilization occur with
          similar frequency and content to people of both genders and of all
          ages, races, levels of education, socioeconomic levels,
          spiritual/religious affiliations (or non-affiliation), sexual
          orientations (gay/lesbian, bisexual, or heterosexual), and
          precipitating circumstances (illness, accident, suicide, medical
          procedure, etc.). Research in non-Western cultures has not been as
          extensive but suggests that certain universal or very common themes
          may be present, such as a boundary between dimensions and one or more
          supernatural entities or beings.
